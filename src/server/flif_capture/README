The 'flif_capture' server captures screenshots of a framebuffer session by
proxying a 'Framebuffer' and an 'Input' session. Screenshots are triggered
when the "Print Screen" ("PrtSc" on Thinkpads) key event is intercepted
and are written to a VFS instance in the FLIF image format.

Usage
-----

Only few Genode components make direct 'Input' and 'Framebuffer' connections,
the recommendation is to use these session bundled in a 'Gui' connection.
Therefore to screenshot 'Gui' clients a GUI server must be running
as a client of the 'flif_capture' server, and a window manager may be necessary
as well. The 'flif_capture', 'nitpicker', and 'wm' stack may be hosted recursively
by using the 'gui_fb' server beneath 'flif_capture'.
